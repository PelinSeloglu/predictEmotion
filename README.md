# predictEmotion 

CK+48 dataset is used in this project.<br />
The dataset must be in the folder format given below. The predict process uses the photos in the test folder.<br />
The temoji folder contains a sample emoji for each emotion.<br />
The "fullp" used in the final code cell is the file path of the emoji instances. The naming of emojis has an important place in the code. Don't forget to change the naming in the code.<br />
